# zero

zero is a game framework for Go based on [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org).  It is an experimental project that should not be used in production applications.  Currently, only Mac OS X is supported.  That being said, both Go and SDL are cross-platform, so with the right cgo directives, it could probably run on other systems.

## Dependencies

zero requires [SDL 2](https://libsdl.org) and [SDL Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) to be installed on the system.
